#Kotlin - learning the ways of ketchup

I have started the journey to know the origin of ketchup. Follow my lead fellow Tomato and together we shall learn the ways to make our code a puree.

The line above is pure(e)ly satirical and should be taken as such. I have started to learn Kotlin with the start of 2021 - mostly to finally try to achieve my dreams of creating my own application. I hope that, in time, I will be able to present the results of my work.

If you wandered here by accident - please be gentle with me! I'm still learning! But of course feel free to message me and comment my code to help me get better or fix something stupid I wrote. Cheers and hail the Tomato!
